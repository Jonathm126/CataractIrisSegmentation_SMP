Must:
- move checkpoitns to chkpt folder
- add transforms and compare
- evaluate time with torch.benchmark

nth:
- add hausdorff metric and train by it
- More models?
- 

comparison notebook:
* Evaluate metrics and compare for models.
* compare with old and new transform, and with old and new metrics
* effect of epochs


separate evaluation script:
compare histogram of iou and hausdorff distance
