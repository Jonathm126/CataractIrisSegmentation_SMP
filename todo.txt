* Generate masks for test data for all models.
* Evaluate metrics and compare for models.
 * I plan to add the hausdorff metric which is the interesting one for our case. + Add average eye diameter normalization.
* Evaluate time with torch.benchmark.
* More models?


separate evaluation script:
compare histogram of iou and hausdorff distance

- add loss for circularity?
- transforms from Zion
- named loaded images
